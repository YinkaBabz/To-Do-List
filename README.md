# To-Do List App (PHP)

This To-Do List App is a simple yet functional task management web application built using **PHP**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and **MySQL**.  
It allows users to create, view, edit, and delete daily tasks in a clean and user-friendly interface.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Add, edit, and delete tasks dynamically.
- Mark tasks as complete or pending.
- Store all tasks in a MySQL database for persistence.
- Simple and responsive user interface using HTML and CSS.
- Backend logic built with core PHP (no frameworks required).

## ðŸ§  How It Works
The app connects to a MySQL database and performs CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations through PHP scripts.  
It demonstrates fundamental web development skills such as database connectivity, server-side scripting, and form handling.

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Install **XAMPP** or **WAMP** to set up a local PHP and MySQL environment.
2. Move the project folder to your `htdocs` directory.
3. Create a MySQL database (for example, `todo_app`) and import the included SQL file (`todo.sql`) if available.
4. Update your database credentials inside the `config.php` file.
5. Open your browser and visit:
http://localhost/todo-list-app/
